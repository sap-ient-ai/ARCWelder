wtf? 🔼 and 🔽 are described as "small red", but they render as "keycaps".
There's actually:
🔺 U+1F53A UP-POINTING RED TRIANGLE
🔻 U+1F53B DOWN-POINTING RED TRIANGLE
And these seem to render correctly.

"Geometric Shapes" has:
▲ U+25B2 BLACK UP-POINTING TRIANGLE
▼ U+25BC BLACK DOWN-POINTING TRIANGLE
... which FAIL to render the same as the left/right ones.
So why does the thing that logically should work fail, and the thing that logically should fail work? What the FUCK?
